# Machine learning tools

<b>Classify languages [Java]</b> - it is a language classifier (English/Czech/German), which uses perceptron to do it
<br>
<b>KNN - k-nearest neighbors algorithm [Java] </b> - this program apply k-NN classifier based on the train set to each vector from the test set and produce the accuracy (here for flowers "Irsises")
<br>
<b>Perceptron classifier [Java] </b> - progam for cliassifing Irises which use perceptron to do it. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.
<br>
<b>K-means [Java] </b> - it displays the composition of the clusters and display some measure of "purity" of the clusters using k-Means clustering algorithm
<br>
<b>Naive Bayes Classifier [Java] </b> - this is a implementation of a naive bayes classifier on data from the Car set
