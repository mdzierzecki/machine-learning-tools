# Classify languages: single-layer neuron network [Java]

Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

We have Irises (a type of flower) in three groups: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginca. Herein program learn from train data and then classify all examples loaded from the text file (Irises) containing the test-set. 

Moreover I provide simple GUI to check any new item.

Everything has been done without any Machine Learning external libraries.
