The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,[14] just a little over a year since the millionth Wikipedian registered an account in late February 2006.[15]

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.[16] Over 30,000 editors perform more than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been performed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language is not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.[citation needed]

Arbitration committee
Program.Main article: Arbitration Committee
The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was created by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][failed verification]

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23] For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikipedia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]
