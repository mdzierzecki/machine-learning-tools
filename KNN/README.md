# k-nearest neighbors algorithm [Java]

K Nearest Neighbour is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure. It is mostly used to classifies a data point based on how its neighbours are classified.

This simple program apply k-NN classifier based on the train set to each vector from the test set and produce the accuracy (here for flowers "Irsises")

The program also provides a simple interface to input single vectors by the user to be classified.

Everything has been done without any Machine Learning libraries. The only one was java.lang.Math ;)
